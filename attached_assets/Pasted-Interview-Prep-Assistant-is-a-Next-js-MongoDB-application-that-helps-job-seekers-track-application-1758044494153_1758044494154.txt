Interview Prep Assistant is a Next.js + MongoDB application that helps job seekers track applications and prepare for interviews interactively.
Beyond CRUD, it integrates Google Gemini AI to generate role-specific interview questions and provide feedback on answers, making interview preparation more engaging and personalized.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
1. Job Applications Management (CRUD)

2. AI-Powered Interview Prep Assistant (Gemini)
